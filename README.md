## Preview

Without the software, a computer it's just a metallic box. With the software, the computer can store, process and recover information.

There is two types of software:
- **System Programs:** These are programs that control the operations of the computer.
- **Application Programs:** These are programs that solves user's problems (e.g. internet browser, text editor, etc).

The system programs are essential for the correct function of the application programs. 

A few years ago, it was so difficult to develop software because it was needed to control the operations of the computer. So, a solution was to apply a level of software with the target of control the all operations of the computer. This level of software is the **operating system,** and it's the most important system program of all.
